              <h2>Anbumani The Person</h2> <h2 class="classic-title"><span></span></h2> 


  <p class="text-justify">Anbumani Ramadoss, a name that has created history of sorts in the books of Indian healthcare; today is an iconic leader who has galvanized huge public opinion with his visionary outlook for Tami Nadu as PMK’s chief ministerial candidate.  He is known crusading efforts demanding the ban of tobacco and bringing about total prohibition of alcohol in the country.</p>
   
  <p class="text-justify">Serving office as the youngest cabinet minister at 35, Anbumani’s tenure in the ministry marked a milestone of bold reforms and innovative schemes that drew attention and appreciation from global leaders including the General Secretary of United Nations Mr. Ban Ki Moon who described him as a ‘public health champion’.</p>
  
  <p class="text-justify">Anbumani’s pet project ‘The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM)’ that was established in 2005 witnessed worldwide recognition and was lauded as ‘the largest successful health scheme to be implemented anywhere in the world’ by the global economist Geoffrey Sacks. Today, Anbumani is a man on a fanatic mission to make Tamil Nadu a model state to the world.</p>

 <p class="text-justify">Born into an agrarian family in 1968 to Dr. S. Ramadoss and Ms. R. Saraswathi, Anbumani completed his SSLC from Montfort Boys Higher Secondary School, Yercaud in 1984. He finished his higher secondary in 1986 from St. Ann's Higher Secondary School, Tindivanam and stood first in the district.  He chose to pursue medicine -MBBS and entered The Madras Medical College, the second oldest college in Asia through an open competition. He has also studied introductory macro-economics at London School of Economics –LSE.  Anbumani always had a longing to take quality healthcare to the rural masses.  This prompted him to spend one and a half years of his initial career serving as a medical practitioner in Nallalam, a small village near Tindivanam.
</p>  
 <h4>Leading Pasumai Thayagam</h4>
			  <h4 class="classic-title"><span></span></h4>
              <p class="text-justify">After a few years of practicing medicine in the rural parts of TN, Anbumani returned to Chennai to lead a green NGO called ‘Pasumai Thayagam’ founded in 1995 by Dr. S. Ramadoss. During his tenure, he organized to plant over 25 lakh trees and desilted more than 1000 lakes and built about 50 check dams to conserve water. He led a number of protests to highlight environmental degradation thereby facilitating access for Pasumai Thayagam to ECOSOC (United Nations Economic and Social Council), the United Nations' central platform for reflection, debate, and innovative thinking on sustainable development. He also got Pasumai Thayagam a special consultative status with the United Nations Human Rights Council General Debate in 2013. The organization witnessed incredible recognition worldwide under his exemplary leadership to an extent that Pasumai Thayagam is today accredited to being the lone member from TN to the United Nations Human Rights Council.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">Anbumani’s participation at global conferences and summits broadened his vision of a green nation. He took part in the Hannover Conference 2000 in Germany, the "World Earth Summit" at Johannesburg, South Africa in September, 2002 and "World Water Forum" at Kyoto, Japan in February, 2003.  He also attended the Copenhagen Global Earth Summit 2012 in Denmark.</p>
<h4>As the Union Health Minister of India</h4>
<h4 class="classic-title"><span></span></h4>
<p class="text-justify">Anbumani chose politics as an active career that brought him laurels and international acclaim for his impeccable accomplishments as the Union Health and Family Welfare Minister of India (2004- 2009). </p>
<p class="text-justify">Awe-stuck by the efficiency of 911, the ambulance emergency service at New York, Anbumani vowed to see it as his dream for India and that’s how 108 ambulance service was born. Notwithstanding the immense pessimism, he went on to successfully implement his dream project of the ‘108 ambulance service’ across 20 states, including Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. This service has proven to have saved millions of lives in India of which nearly 24% of the calls were for maternity services and 21% for road accidents. </p>
<p class="text-justify">Anbumani is a crusader against the evils of alcohol and tobacco. His signature contribution towards stringent controls on tobacco and alcohol were the ban on smoking in public places (including work places), ban on tobacco advertising, ban on sale of tobacco products to minors and ban on sale of tobacco products within 100 yards of educational institutions.  </p>
<p class="text-justify">Undeterred of his efforts to take on the liquor lobby, Anbumani travelled unscathed in his journey and made it mandatory to show warning messages while smoking and drinking scenes were depicted in movies and television shows. He also implemented pictorial warning on all tobacco products. Alcohol is a state subject as per the constitution of India. But, Anbumani initiated a ‘National Alcohol Policy’ for the first time in India and forcefully put forth his arguments at the World Health Organization and advocated for the 2nd of October, the birthday of Gandhiji to be observed as World No-Alcohol day.  </p>
<p class="text-justify">As the Union Health Minister, he took major steps to eradicate polio from India which was commended when the President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee who presented him with a memento of appreciation on March 29, 2014 at the inauguration of Rotary International’s Polio-Free Conclave 2014, in New Delhi. His untiring efforts saw a steep reduction of 50% in the prevalence of HIV AIDS in India.  </p>

<p class="text-justify">Anbumani was instrumental in the expansion of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi. He also launched the National Program for Control of Diabetes, Cardiovascular disease and Stroke. He was responsible for setting up the Public Health Foundation of India, Department of Health Research (DHR), the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, the Food Safety and Standards Authority and the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library. At a time when Indian citizens were diagnosed iodine deficient, he made consumption of iodised salt compulsory and introduced the ‘Auto Disposable Syringe’. The National Institute of Siddha was set up by him in Chennai on September 3, 2005 during his tenure. </p>

<h2>Anbumani The Best CM Candidate </h2>
<h2 class="classic-title"><span></span></h2>  
<p  class="text-justify">Anbumani currently serves as a Member of Parliament from Dharmapuri constituency of Tamil Nadu which he won with a thumping victory despite the show of massive money and state muscle power of the ruling party and the equally powerful Dravidian opposition party which lost without winning even a single seat. He has been relentlessly travelling all over Tamil Nadu raising pertinent issues and fighting the inefficient non-functional government machinery. Anbumani is seen as a promising leader for decent and developmental politics in the state which is currently crippled by precariously non-functional governance. </p>
                
<p  class="text-justify">Tamil Nadu is in dire need of a leader who can provide transformational change and progress from the current developmental and moral paralysis contributed by 50 years of Dravidian party misrule. The state desperately needs someone who can make the state, The glory of India With an impeccable track record of governance at the centre as Union Health Minister winning several unmatched prestigious awards for his accomplishments and a crusading force in the state fighting against corruption, liquor malaise and freebie culture, Anbumani is all set to make a mark in the minds and hearts of people for the upcoming assembly elections of Tamil Nadu in 2015/16 as a Chief Ministerial candidate.  </p>

<p  class="text-justify">Today there is all but a singular voice echoing the agony of the people of Tamil Nadu through numerous daily public meetings and anti-alcohol protests in every nook and corner of the state. That voice is none other than the voice of Anbumani, the humble and yet determinant leader, whose vision to provide a corrupt free, growth oriented, people centric governance will be made possible with his singular request. A request for a rightful ҏne ChanceҬ that can change and lead Tamil Nadu to glory.</p>
